Instamint
===================================

**Instamint** is a platform for minting, managing, auctioning, staking, fractionalizing and trading digital business assets. The platform is unbiased, works with multiple chains and has a growing library of types of assets it can handle. It is a B2B platform, and thus a platform to/for other platforms. It combines off-chain capabilities with on-chain tokens.

Key Concepts
------------

An NFT is a token that represents a business *asset*. Each NFT has a unique *token identifier* and typically points to rich data that describes and defines that asset. The asset may be an image, a video, a municipal bond, shipping container or an award badge. Instamint provides the tools to manage these type of assets via an API. Each asset also has a unique identifier and is correlated with the token identifier. An Instamint *client* is a B2B user of the Instamint platform that requires such services.

Instamint *parties* are entities, human or corporate, that have relationships with business assets. The four type of parties typically associated with an asset are *partners* (synonmous with client), *issuers* or creators, *owners* and *custodians*. Parties are created and registered in Instamint as simply a named entity, no other information is stored. Each party has a unique party ID and each party can be associated with one or more blockchain accounts or wallets and each party is associated with a B2B reference ID meaningful only to the partner or client. An NFT has at least four parties associated with it - the client/partner that created it, the issuer, current owner and custodian.

The Instamint *asset library* is a library of the types and templates of assets that can be turnkey minted. For example, a municipal bond may be in the asset library and any entity in the US that wishes to mint a municipal bond can simply use the template if it meets their requirements.


Overview
---------

Currently, Instamint is three sets of APIs, each serving a specific purpose for clients. They are:

+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| API       | Description                                                                                  |
+===========+==============================================================================================+
| Meta      | Manage multi-asset cross-chain NFTs and accounts                                             |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Disburse  | Royalties, fractionalization, payment settlement and auction engine                          |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Yield     | Staking NFTs in best-of-breed DeFi protocols                                                 |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


**Console** is the dashboard applications where partners can track their inventory of assets, manage API keys and view analytics. 


Multichain
-----------

Instamint is multichain, meaning that tokens can be minted across a number of blockchains, currently Ethereum and Algorand (testing). Additional chains are planned to be supported and come online over the coming quarters.

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Chain     | Support Level                                                                                             |
+===========+===========================================================================================================+
| Ethereum  | Supported - ERC721, ERC1155                                                                               |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Algorand  | ARC3                                                                             |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Polygon   | Q2 2023                                                                                                   |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
